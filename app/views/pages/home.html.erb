      <h2>Why Poopt-it?</h2>
      <p>It started as a simple idea: An urgent need is something that everybody knows. We all have been in the situation where it happens when you are far from friendly facilities. There's still the option to walk in a restaurant, but not all of them will accept it, and you take the risk to end up in a dirty, unsafe toilet. That is why weâ€™re working to make restroom facilitation safer and more accessible, helping people find clean and luxurious bathrooms quickly and affordably. Our hosts garantee the cleanliness of their toilet spots, as well as the constant resupply of toilet paper, soap, and the maintenance of all the facilities. <br><br>
